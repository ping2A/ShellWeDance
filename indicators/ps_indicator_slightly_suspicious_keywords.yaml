name: Slightly suspicious keywords
description: This is a generic indicator to match against a list of keywords, absolutely not malicious on their own but used for contextual enrichment and weak-signal correlation. Also refer to other indicators ending with 'keywords' as they also accomodate multiple keywords but for higher signals. Keywords might be removed and added to a more specific indicator in the future.
