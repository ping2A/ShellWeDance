name: Suspicious TLD reference
description: >
  Detects URLs referencing high-risk or abuse-prone top-level domains and
  dynamic DNS providers commonly used by malware, phishing, and C2 infrastructure.
  These domains are frequently leveraged due to low cost, anonymity, and fast
  rotation, making them attractive for command-and-control, payload hosting,
  and phishing campaigns.
